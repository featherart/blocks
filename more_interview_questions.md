Great advice on whiteboarding:

Buy a small whiteboard and practice, practice, practice. Have your friends ask you questions from a book such as "Programming Interviews Exposed" (http://www.amazon.com/dp/047012167X/?tag=stackoverfl08-20) or something more recent. 

Practice solving the problems and explaining your thought processes to them exactly as you would in the real deal. Your goal is to not sound frantic. You want to articulate clear thoughts. Even if you can't solve the problem, show them that your thought process is intelligent and on the right track. Eventually your handwriting will improve and you will be much clearer at explaining your thought process. Practicing the act of whiteboarding might be as important as learning how to answer common interview questions, as they are evaluating your ability to communicate clearly and think under pressure as well as your ability to solve the problem.

Some questions:

- "Please can you explain in as much detail as you like how a web browser gets a generated page"

- "I ask the candidate to design a solution to a problem I actually encountered in my day to day work. Doing so, I try to create a dialog between me and the candidate. I try to discuss about the design he is building as if I had never thought about the problem before. What I try to evaluate is whether we are able to understand each other, and whether we can talk about a technical problem without confusion."

- "FIZZBUZZ!"

- "Implement the operations of insert before, insert after and delete on a singly linked list."
